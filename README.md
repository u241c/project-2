# Nootropic

A simple app that performes CRUD, Named Nootropics. Why am I building this app? I was inspired by the movie "Limitless". Nootropics are refered to as any natural or synthetic substance that may have a positive impact on mental skill. I have tried nootropics cause of my many failures in school. Inability to focus and remember information. FYI, the pill in the movie, NZT-48 does not exist.
